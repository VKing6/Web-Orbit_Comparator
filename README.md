# Web-Orbit_Comparator
Database/PHP: Compare satellite orbits

## Concept
1. Database of satellites (natural or artificial) in the solar system
2. Web page with php that retrieves and compares the orbits of two satellites
3. Print orbital information, distance, possibly closest pass, possibly allow to swipe the date
4. Possibly create orbital maps, possibly using CSS svg function.
